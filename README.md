### In my repositories you'll find
- **Open source software**
  - [Stats Viewer](https://github.com/nahuef/statsViewer) Tool to track score progress and performance improvement on Kovaak's FPS Aim Trainer. Over 1k downloads.
- **[NPM libraries](https://www.npmjs.com/~nahue "NPM libraries"):**
  - [require-indexjs](https://github.com/nahuef/require-indexjs "require-indexjs") To automagically export every module in a directory. *Check it out, it's pretty cool!*
  - [property-waterfall](https://github.com/nahuef/property-waterfall "property-waterfall") To fetch a value that can have different key names in the same (or a set of) object/s. *Ever had to get the IP address from either headers, user-agent, querystring, body..?*
- **Code challenges.** 
  - Like Github's[ NOOPS Pathbot challenge](https://noopschallenge.com/challenges/pathbot " noop Pathbot challenge"). At the moment of writting this I believe [my submission](https://github.com/nahuef/pathbot "my submission") is the only one with an [automated maze solver](https://github.com/nahuef/pathbot/blob/master/solver.js "automated maze solver").
- **Open source contributions.** The opportunistic ones like typos and documentation.
- **Dotfiles.** Not much to see [here](https://github.com/nahuef/dotfiles "here"), told you I'm a minimalist.
