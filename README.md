<h1 align='center'>Hi there, I'm Nahuel ðŸ‘‹</h1><br>

A minimalist back-end engineer who loves to KISS (keep it stupid simple).

I enjoy most designing and implementing solutions with **AWS** and **Node.js**.



------------


#### In my repositories you'll find
- **NPM libraries:**
  - [require-indexjs](https://github.com/nahuef/require-indexjs "require-indexjs") To automagically export every module in a directory. *Check it out, it's pretty cool!*
  - [property-waterfall](https://github.com/nahuef/property-waterfall "property-waterfall") To fetch a value that can have different key names in the same (or a set of) object/s. *Ever had to get the IP address from either headers, user-agent, querystring, body..?*
- **Open source contributions.** The opportunistic ones like typos and documentation.
- **Code challenges.** 
 - Like Github's[ NOOPS Pathbot challenge](https://noopschallenge.com/challenges/pathbot " noop Pathbot challenge"). At the moment of writting this I believe [my submission](https://github.com/nahuef/pathbot "my submission") is the only one with an [automated maze solver](https://github.com/nahuef/pathbot/blob/master/solver.js "automated maze solver").
- **Dotfiles.** Not much to see here, told you I'm a minimalist.

*TODO: Add pictures of my cats.*
